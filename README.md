# Commenter25/gmodstuffs
a collection of gmod scripts and such i made that aren't big enough projects for their own repo

## ⭳ Downloads
Everything in this repository is a single standalone file. You can click the name of a tool below, and you'll be directed to the file.

To install it, go to `garrysmod/addons`, make a new addon folder, and download the file to the same folder it's in in this repo. For example, to download NPC Capabilities, you'd place it in `garrysmod/addons/npccaps/lua/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/npccaps.lua`.

Alternatively, this repository is one big addon with everything combined. You can download the entire thing, and just placing it into your addons folder will work fine.

<summary>Nerdy details irrelevant to actually downloading anything</summary>

The repo is formatted this way because of how Gmod works, and the major inconvenience separating everything would cause to downloading and mounting; and how GitHub works, not allowing you to download an individual folder. Because of this structure, if anything requires more than one file, it'll almost certainly become its own repository. But this works for really basic and niche tools, which is probably all this repo will be.

### [NPC Capabilities](lua/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/npccaps.lua)

[**1.0.0**](lua/weapons/gmod_tool/stools/npccaps-CHANGELOG.md)

A tool that prints the [capabilities](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Enums/CAP) of an NPC, using the actual variable names instead of an obtuse number. But you can also get the obtuse number if you want it. Made in the hopes it'll be useful to someone like me who spent at least an hour trying to figure out what the fuck a bitflag is and just wanted a picture of a got dang hot dog
